kitchen raspberry pi will send messages on rabbitmq such as
{"location": "kitchen", "type": "motion", "message": "motion detected", "timestamp": "2016-07-15Z12:00:00"}

HA-pi-eater will receive these messages and store them in a database
it will also check business rules for those sensors and if certain conditions are met
this will also emit events on rabbitmq for


HA-pi-UI
Angular/React based UI to show realtime sensor information and events triggered
will also be able to manual do things such as turn lights on/off...
need to figure out how to make sure manually triggered things happen when automation will invert them...
such as turn lights on during time when automation wants to turn them off...either through the UI or by physical switch

HA-pi-cookbook
this app will store the various business rules in json format
